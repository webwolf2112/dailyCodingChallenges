O(n)  The same as O(n + 2) || O(10n)  => I roughly translates into as long as it's all looping over the same n (no nested it will be O(n))

O(n2)  -> N squared - occures with nested loops



General Rules of Thumb:
	
	1) It's usually O(1) if it does the following:
		
		I) Arithmetic Operation
		II) Variable Assignment
		III) Accessing an Array by Index or Object by Key.  ex: testArrayOrObject['grabit_by_this_key']

	2) In a loop the complexity is the length of the loop thies whatever complexity is in the loop
